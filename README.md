# AI Flashcards Application

This Next.js application leverages AI to generate flashcards based on user prompts and integrates with the Stripe API to handle payments. Users can create, search, and access their flashcards, with data securely stored in Firebase.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Flashcards**: Create flashcards from user prompts using advanced AI models.
- **Payment Integration**: Manage payments for premium features with Stripe.
- **Firebase Integration**: Store and manage flashcards securely in Firebase.
- **Search Functionality**: Search and access previously created flashcards.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flashcards-app.git
   cd flashcards-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=path_to_your_firebase_credentials.json
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
   ```

   - `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` should be the path to your Firebase credentials JSON file.
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is your Stripe secret key for server-side operations.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` is your Stripe public key for client-side operations.

4. **Configure Firebase**

   - Set up a Firebase project and download the service account key.
   - Place the `credentials.json` file in your project directory and update the `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` path in the `.env.local` file.

## Development

1. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

2. **Building the Application**

   To create an optimized production build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   After building, you can start the production server with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```



## Configuration

- **Firebase**: Ensure the Firebase credentials file is properly configured in `.env.local`.
- **Stripe**: Confirm that both the Stripe secret and public keys are set correctly in `.env.local`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Firebase Connection Issues**: Verify the path to your Firebase credentials and ensure it's correctly configured.
- **Stripe Errors**: Double-check your Stripe keys and ensure they are correctly set in `.env.local`.
- **Payment Issues**: Ensure that the payment amount and currency are specified correctly.
